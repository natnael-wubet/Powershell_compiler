This Powershell compiler is help full to compile, edit and test your powershell script project.

As a powershell programmer, I wouldnt recommend you to use this tool for editing purpose infact Ps ISE is the best one for editing powershell script.

But if you wanna compile it to .exe (binary) file or simply if you don't wan't to show the source code, this one is your best friend b/c ISE cant help you with this.

Another best feature of this software is that if you are doing some thing with a group and creating just one thing, you can share it fastly with out any usb drive or other thing (on LAN(Local Area Network)) with wifi. This wont send the script to other web browsers except this tool.
